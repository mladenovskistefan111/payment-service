# Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `50051` | gRPC listen port. **Must be set when relying on the Docker `HEALTHCHECK`** (see below) |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` (set in image) | |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | `http://localhost:4317` | OTLP/**gRPC** endpoint for **traces, metrics and logs** (scheme required), e.g. `http://alloy.monitoring.svc.cluster.local:4317`. Legacy fallback: `COLLECTOR_SERVICE_ADDR` (`host:port`) |
| `OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_INTERVAL` | `15000` | Milliseconds between metric pushes |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` | `payment-service` | `service.name` — becomes the Prometheus `job` and the Loki `service_name`; keep the default, dashboards depend on it |
| `SERVICE_VERSION` | `1.0.0` | `service.version` resource attribute |
| `PYROSCOPE_ADDR` | `http://localhost:4040` | Profiles use the Pyroscope SDK push protocol (**not** OTLP). Point it at Alloy (`http://alloy.monitoring.svc.cluster.local:4040`), which forwards to Pyroscope, or directly at Pyroscope |

Notes:

- There are **no secrets** and no external credentials: the service never talks to a real processor.
- Telemetry is **pushed**, not scraped: traces, metrics and logs share one OTLP/gRPC endpoint (Alloy); profiles go to Pyroscope (via Alloy). `service.instance.id` is the pod hostname, so replicas stay distinct in Mimir.
- The former Prometheus endpoint (`METRICS_PORT`) no longer exists. Logs keep going to stdout and are additionally exported over OTLP with trace ids.
- Telemetry and profiling cannot be switched off with a flag; with no reachable collector the exporters just log errors and the service keeps serving.
